# Generative-deep-learning-with-Tensorflow-assignements

This repository contains my answers to the Generative deep learning with TensorFlow in Coursera. In this course, we explored style transfer and generative models such as Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) and Generative adversarial Network (GAN). We also:

1) Built AutoEncoders on the MNIST dataset and the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2) Implemented de-noising algorithms using an AutoEncoder to produce a clean image from a noisy one.
3) Explored Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to generate entirely new data for anime faces. 
4) Built our own GAN that can generate fake hands.
