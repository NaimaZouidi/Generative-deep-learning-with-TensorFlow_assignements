# Generative-deep-learning-with-TensorFlow-assignements

This repository contain my answers to the Generative deep learning with TensorFlow in Coursera. In this course we explored style transfer and generative models such as Auto-encoders and Generative adversarial network (GAN). We also:

1) Built AutoEncoders on the MNIST dataset and the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2) Implemented de-noising algorithmse using an AutoEncoder to produce a clean image from a noisy one.
3) Explored Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to generate entirely new data for anime faces. 
4) Built our own GAN that can generate fake hands.
